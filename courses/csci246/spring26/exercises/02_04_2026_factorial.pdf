\begin{problem}{1}
  Suppose you have $n$ books and $n$ shelves on your bookshelf. 
  How many ways can you arrange the books so that each shelf has
  exactly one book?
  \vspace*{0.5em}

  \textbf{A}. $n = 1$: \qquad $1! = 1$
  \vspace*{0.75em}

  \textbf{B}. $n = 2$: \qquad $2! = 2$
  \vspace*{0.75em}

  \textbf{C}. $n = 3$: \qquad $3! = 6$
  \vspace*{0.75em}

  \textbf{D}. $n = 4$: \qquad $4! = 24$
  \vspace*{0.75em}

  \textbf{E}. $n = 5$: \qquad $5! = 120$
  \vspace*{0.75em}

  \textbf{F}. $n = 6$: \qquad $6! = 720$

\begin{problem}{2}~

  \textbf{A}. Give a relationship between orderings of lists and factorials.
  \vspace*{0.5em}

  The number of permutations of a list of length $n$ is $n!$. Or alternatively,
  the number of lists of length $n$ from $n$ elements with no repeats is $(n)_n = n!$
  \vspace*{5.5em}

  \textbf{B}. Define $n!$ in terms of a product (e.g., $n! = \Pi_{k=...}^{...} e_k$)
  \vspace*{0.5em}
  \[
    n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...1 = \prod_{k=1}^{n} k
  \]
  \vspace*{0.5em}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{3}
  Give an explanation \emph{in terms of counting} why $(n)_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.
  \vspace*{0.5em}

  The number of lists of length $k$ with no repeats from $n$ distinct elements is $(n)_k$.
  Similarly, the number of lists of length $n$ with no repeats from $n$ distinc elements is $n!$.

  One way to count the number of lists of length $k$ with no repeats from $n$ elements, is to first
  count the number of lists with no repeats that uses all $n$ elements (i.e., $n!$ total lists).
  However, we are only concerned with how many unique prefixes of length $k$ there are. Thus, we wish
  to ignore the last $(n - k)$ elements of the $n$ length lists. For each unique $k$ length prefix, there
  are a total of $(n - k)!$ ways to complete the list. Hence, why there are a total of $(n)_k = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$
  unique $k$ length prefixes of the $n$-length lists with no repeats.

\begin{problem}{4}
  Let $A = \{a, b, c, d, e\}$ be a set of elements.

  \textbf{A}. How many lists of length $5$ can be made with elements of $A$? \qquad $5^5 = 3125$
  \vspace*{1em}

  \textbf{B}. How many lists of length $5$ with no repeats? \qquad $5! = 120$
  \vspace*{1em}

  \textbf{C}. How many subsets of $A$ have size $5$? \qquad $1$
  \vspace*{1em}

  \textbf{D}. How many lists of length $2$?  \qquad $5^2 = 25$
  \vspace*{1em}

  \textbf{E}. How many lists of length $2$ with no repeats? \qquad $(5)_2 = 5*4 = 20$
  \vspace*{1em}

  \textbf{F}. How many subsets of size $2$? \qquad $(5)_2 / 2! = 5 * 4 / 2 = 10$.
  \vspace*{1em}

  \textbf{G}. How many lists of length 3 that begin with $a$? \qquad $1 * 5^2 = 25$
  \vspace*{1em}

  \textbf{H}. How many lists of length 3 with no repeats that begin with $a$? \qquad $1 * (4)_2 = 1 * 4 * 3 = 12$.
  \vspace{1em}

  \textbf{I}. How many subsets of size 3 that contain $a$? \qquad $1 * (4)_2 / 2! = 1  * 4 * 3 / 2 = 6$

\begin{problem}{5}
  Suppose you have 5 French books, 3 Spanish Books, 4 English Books, and 12 German books
  and you want to order them on your book shelf.
  \vspace*{0.5em}

  \textbf{A}. How many ways can you order the books?
  \vspace*{0.5em}

  $(5 + 3 + 4 + 12)! = 24! = 620448401733239439360000$
  \vspace*{1em}

  \textbf{B}. How many ways if you want to keep books organized by language?
  \vspace*{0.5em}

  (number of ways to order languages) $\times$ (number of ways to order books within each language)

  $4! \times (5! \times 3! \times 4! \times 12!) = 24 \times (120 \times 6 \times 24 \times 479001600) = 198651543552000$

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{6}
  Make a conjecture to the value of the following summation:
\[
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} k \times k! = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k + 1 - 1) \times k! = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k + 1)k! - k! = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k+1)! - k!
\]
\[
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k+1)! - k! = (2! - 1!) + (3! -2!) + ... ((n + 1)! - n!) = (n + 1)! - 1
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{7}
  Give an argument why for any integers $k$ and $n$, if $2 \leq k \leq n$, then $n! + k$ is composite.
  \vspace*{0.5em}

  \begin{proof}
  Note, by definition $n! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \dots \times n$. Since $2 \leq k \leq n$, we know that
  $k$ must be one of the factors of $n!$ (i.e, $k | n!$). Necessarily, there must be some integer $m$ such that
  $n! = k \times m$. Now consider, $n! + k = k \times m + k = k(m + 1)$. Clearly, $k | (n! +k)$. Necesarrily,
  $1 < k < n! + k$. Thus, $n! + k$ is composite.
  \end{proof}
